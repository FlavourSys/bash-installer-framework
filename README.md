# Installer Framework

This is our new menu-based generic installer framework. See the `tasks` directory for installation task examples, see files in `utils` to get an idea of what you can do wrt. logging, `UI` things, and the like.

## Getting started

Not much to do here, simply copy over `install.sh`, `config.sh` and the `utils` directory to your project, modify the `config.sh` and start creating tasks.
